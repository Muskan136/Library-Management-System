# Library-Management-System
The Library Management System is a Python-based application that helps manage the operations of a library. It provides functionalities to add new books, issue books to members, submit returned books, delete books, and display all available books in the library. The application uses MySQL as the database to store and manage library data efficiently.


Features-
Add Book: Allows the librarian to add new books to the library database with details such as book name, book code, total number of copies, and subject.
Issue Book: Records the issuance of a book to a member by storing member details and book code.
Submit Book: Records the submission of a book by a member, updating the available stock accordingly.
Delete Book: Enables the librarian to remove a book from the library database using the book code.
Display Books: Displays all the books available in the library along with their details.


Technologies Used-
Python: For the application logic.
MySQL: For database management.
PyCharm: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and testing the code.
Selenium: For any potential web automation tasks (not directly used in this project).
